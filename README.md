# Lost-Found
That’s great, Abhishek 👏
Since this is your **college project**, your README should look professional but still natural and human-written — not robotic.

Below is a **7-section humanized README** you can directly copy into your `README.md` file and edit according to your project name.

# 🌐 Community Lost & Found Portal

> A simple, responsive web application built as a **college project** to help people report and find lost items easily within a community.

---

## 📌 1. About The Project

This project is a **Community Lost & Found Portal** developed using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

The main goal of this website is to provide a simple and user-friendly platform where users can:

* Report lost items
* Post found items
* Upload images
* Search for items
* Contact the owner

This project was created as part of my **college academic work** to understand real-world web development concepts including frontend design, authentication, and cloud storage integration.

## ⚙️ 2. How The Website Works

The workflow of the website is simple:

1. A user signs up or logs in using Google Authentication.
2. The user can:

   * Report a lost item
   * Report a found item
3. The user uploads item details along with an image.
4. The image is stored in cloud storage (Cloudinary).
5. Item details are stored in the database (Firebase / Supabase).
6. Other users can browse or search items.
7. If someone finds a match, they can contact the owner.

The system is designed to be responsive and works on both desktop and mobile devices.

## 🏗️ 3. Project Structure

Below is the basic folder structure of the project:

```
production/
├── index.html     → js/index.js     + css/index.css
├── login.html     → js/login.js     + css/login.css
├── lost.html      → js/lost.js      + css/lost.css

This structure keeps the project clean and maintainable.
